# Free-D Rust Protocol

I found that there were very few public implementations of the Free-D protocol available, and none that implemented the entire protocol.

This aims to provide a library of all the types used by the FreeD protocol, in rich Rust semantics.

All the payload messages are implemented, alongside a simple `Serialise` and `Deserialise` trait interface.
